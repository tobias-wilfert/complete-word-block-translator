# Complete Word Block Translator

## Why?  
The Lego Mindstorms Robot Inventor can be programmed in both Blockly(Scratch) and Python and while the Blockly interface is great to start off it becomes tiresome for bigger projects. So switching to Python seems like a no-brainer.  
Sadly the documentation is less than ideal, and it is not always evident how the corresponding Python code for a Block looks like.   The creators of Mindstorms seemed to have been aware of this and so they added the *Word Block Translator* which is a list of Blocks together with the corresponding Python code. Sadly this list is extremely limited.  

## What?  
This repository is intended to be a more complete list (Preferably having the equivalent Python code for all Blocks).

## What next?
Once this is done it can then be used as a stepping stone for a convertor between Mindstorms Word Blocks and Python. A feature that is sadly not provided by Mindstorms.
